  <para>Using original algorithms, this tool provides, for the first time ever, the accentuation of Latin words and their pronunciation (including their IPA transcription) in both Classical and Ecclesiastical Latin. In addition, it offers a concise introduction to Latin phonetics in Latin.&#13;</para>
  <para>The introduction has been authored by Dr XXXXXXXXX (sections 1, 2, and 3) and Prof. XXXXXXXXX (sections 4 and 5). The prosodic information has been generated by building on the âsyllabifierâ shared by both CLTK (http://cltk.org/) and Collatinus (https://github.com/biblissima/collatinus/blob/master/bin/data/hyphen.la), including the list of âexceptionsâ made by Rev. FrÃ¨re Romain Marie de l'Abbaye Saint-Joseph de Flavigny-sur-Ozerain in 2016.  The list of Latin lemmas has been created using XXXXXXXXXX and a freely adapted version of the open source lemmatiser âLemlatâ (http://www.lemlat3.eu/). &#13;</para>
